/**
   Persist Extension Data.

   When the plugin's extension_data is called with argument LV2_PERSIST_URI,
   the plugin MUST return an LV2_Persist structure, which remains valid for the
   lifetime of the plugin.

   The host can use the contained function pointers to save and restore the
   state of a plugin instance at any time (provided the threading restrictions
   for the given function are met).

   The typical use case is to save the plugin's state when a project is saved,
   and to restore the state when a project has been loaded. Other uses are
   possible (e.g. cloning plugin instances or taking a snapshot of plugin
   state).

   Stored data is only guaranteed to be compatible between instances of plugins
   with the same URI (i.e. if a change to a plugin would cause a fatal error
   when restoring state saved by a previous version of that plugin, the plugin
   URI MUST change just as it must when ports change incompatibly). Plugin
   authors should consider this possibility, and always store sensible data
   with meaningful types to avoid such compatibility issues in the future.

	   @param callback_data	An opaque pointer to host data, e.g. the map or
	   file where the values are to be stored. If @a store is called,
	   this MUST be passed as its callback_data parameter.

	   The plugin is expected to store everything necessary to completely
	   restore its state later (possibly much later, in a different process, on
	   a completely different machine, etc.)

	   The @a callback_data pointer and @a store function MUST NOT be used

	   This function has its own special threading class: it may not be called
	   concurrently with any "Instantiation" function, but it may be called
	   concurrently with functions in any other class, unless the definition of
	   that class prohibits it (e.g. it may not be called concurrently with a
	   "Discovery" function, but it may be called concurrently with an "Audio"
	   function. The plugin is responsible for any locking or lock-free
	   techniques necessary to make this possible.

	   Note that in the simple case where state is only modified by restore(),
	   there are no synchronization issues since save() is never called
	   concurrently with restore() (though run() may read it during a save).

	   Plugins that dynamically modify state while running, however, must take
	   care to do so in such a way that a concurrent call to save() will save a
	   consistent representation of plugin state for a single instant in time.
