IR: LV2 Convolution Reverb

Version 1.2.2 and 1.3.2 - 2012.07.02 18:05 CEST
	This pair of versions contains the migration to use zita-convolver-3.x.x in
	place of zita-convolver-2.0.0. This change guarantees that there are no data
	overruns while running the plugin non-realtime (freewheeling / Ardour export).
	NOTE: please read the plugin's webpage if you are confused about the dual versioning
	of IR (1.2.x vs 1.3.x).

Version 1.2.1 and 1.3.1 - 2011.07.10 17:10 CEST
        Fixed Makefile from David Robillard. The change is that the module now relies on
        the GNU linker (via -z nodelete) to prevent unloading instead of reliance on the
        LV2 host obeying lv2:requiredFeature uiext:makeResident.
        This fixes http://tracker.ardour.org/view.php?id=4112
        Note: IR 1.2.1 and 1.3.1 are versions with the same fix applied to IR 1.2 and 1.3,
        respectively. This dual versioning is necessary because 1.2 and 1.3 are in their
        own right both valid, but incompatible, versions. You have to choose which one
        you need - please see the plugin webpage for details.

Version 1.3 - 2011.02.04 18:24 CET
	bugfix release
	* fix when being run with randomly varying block sizes
	* fix issues with automation:
	  http://tracker.ardour.org/view.php?id=3214
	* with very small block sizes zita-convolver doesn't seem to work
	Due to added buffering, these fixes necessitate processing latency (reported
	to host via standard LV2 mechanism). Latency is 2^N samples where N >= 10, its
	actual value depends on the JACK period size.

Version 1.2 - 2011.01.25 17:35 CET
	bugfix & compatibility enhancements release:
	* fix ir.ttl typo: "doap:license" instead of "doap:licence"
	* visual feedback of the progress of resampling operations
	* resampling operations are interruptible; you can no longer crash
	  the plugin by deleting it while resampling a long impulse file
	* correct GTK2 version requirement and check it in the Makefile:
	  at least GTK 2.16 is needed

Version 1.1 - 2011.01.14 21:12 CET
	bugfix release:
	* really use the user's homedir for storing the .ir_save file
	* proper GType and GThread initialization, at the proper place (loading of the plugin shared library)
	* fix ir.ttl: add missing namespace prefix "rdf"
	* fix usage of zita-convolver (proper stopping and deallocating of Convproc instances)
	* fix crash when removing a never-unbypassed plugin instance

Version 1.0 - 2011.01.13. 23:08 CET
	initial public release
